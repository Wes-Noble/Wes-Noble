title: "Geography 176A"

In the summer of 2020 I took a fast paced 6-week GIS course based in R. I started with no previous coding knowledge, but progressed into a confidant data analyst with R scripting skills. Here is a look into my development as a coder and a collection of my work from that course.


## [First Attempt at a Repository](https://github.com/Wes-Noble/hello-world)

- In this assignment I built my first online repository attached to my Github account
- It includes a github repo for access to all the code.
- I learned about basic access and editing of a README.md page
- I also learned the function of directories and where different files should be placed and kept
- Overall, I enjoyed my first step in understanding code better
