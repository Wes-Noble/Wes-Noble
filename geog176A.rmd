title: "Geography 176A"
---

In the summer of 2020 I took a fast paced 6-week GIS course based in R. I started with no previous coding knowledge, but progressed into a confidant data analyst with R scripting skills. Here is a look into my development as a coder and a collection of my work from that course.


## [First Attempt at a Repository](https://github.com/Wes-Noble/hello-world)

- In this assignment I built my first online repository attached to my Github account
- It includes a github repo for access to all the code.
- I learned about basic access and editing of a README.md page
- I also learned the function of directories and where different files should be placed and kept
- Overall, I enjoyed my first step in understanding code better

## [Interpreting NY Times COVID Data](https://wes-noble.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-02.html)

- In this lab we took real time data from NY Times that is tracking current COVID cases across the US and interpreted it in different ways
- We built on our understanding of data frames and object manipulation with dplyr verbs such as filter(), mutate(), and much more
- We practiced our graphing and date presentation skills through ggplot() and how to interpret and present data so that our message is conveyed to the viewer in the manner we wish it to be

## [Quantifying & Qualifying the US Border Zone](https://wes-noble.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-03.html)

- Pulling raw data from online csv files mapping US state city, border, and state data, we joined and filtered multiple data frames to present tables and maps identifying cities furthest from the Canadian, Mexican, and United States borders
- We learned how useful ggrepel and gghighlight can be in data representation while mapping in R
- We developed our knowledge and skills in manipulating CRSs to be able to compare and relate spatial data
- Lastly, in a real world application, we learned that Federal Agency's claim that people do not have basic constitutional rights protected by the Fourth Amendment (protecting Americans from random and arbitrary stops and searches) apply fully at our borders is depriving over 2/3 of Americans population from the Fourth Amendment's protection.
